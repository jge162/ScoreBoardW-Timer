### Meet the team:

>This project was completed in EGCP 446 Fall 2022 by [Duy](https://github.com/duy301199), [Jeremy](https://github.com/jge162) and [Spencer](https://github.com/5pencerW).
Spencer contributed the module used to keep team scores, I contributed by
creating the countdown timer. Lastly, Duy setup the 7 segment!

### Initial setup:
>Install [Xilinx Vivado](https://www.xilinx.com/products/design-tools/vivado.html)

### Download zip folder:
>Open vivado and import project to IDE

### Connect FPGA board:
>Make sure to select correct [FPGA board](https://digilent.com/shop/nexys-a7-fpga-trainer-board-recommended-for-ece-curriculum/), Nexy's A7

### Create Bitstream:
>Once created you can then load program unto board and 
test software running.
